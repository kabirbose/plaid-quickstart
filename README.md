# Plaid Quickstart
The Plaid API has a complex implementation process. This is my barebones quickstart app, allowing you to easily implement Plaid into NextJS 14+ projects.

# Why my quickstart?
- Uses Bun.js
- Written in TypeScript
- Tailwind for styling
- React Context pre-defined
- Less boiler-plate code

# Get started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `bun install` (or use any other package manager)
3. Create a `.env.local` file consisting of your Plaid keys
4. Run the development server
